# Project 3 Plan for team "We Didn't Start the Fire"

## Overview

Name Ideas:
- Crystal Door
- Crystal Pane
- Hardware Limitation (because we, the software engineers are being limited by the hardware, which is the company)


The idea behind ______ is to give software engineers a place to share their experiences working for different companies, and allow those new engineers approaching companies to understand what to expect. By giving an average salary range for different classes of “experience”, it also gives the engineer good information that they can use to negotiate for their worth.

- View a snapshot of each company that shows a general rating from 1-5 with decimals (i.e. 4.3, 1.5 etc.)
- View a “show” page for each company that has more information
- Comment both on the company and individual reviews

- Create reviews that can be as in depth or short as the user wants, to a certain point. ( there needs to be a general rating at the very least)
